This Python script represents the deployment and maintenance of the Ãœber Clone app. It uses a hypothetical `CloudProvider` class to handle the deployment and maintenance tasks. The `deployApp` method deploys the app to the cloud, and the `maintainApp` method updates the app. The script is executed if it is run as the main program.
